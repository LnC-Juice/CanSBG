# CanSBG
SBL grades for view all grades on Canvas

## SBL => letter
- A  =  3.25  -  4.0
- B  =  2.5   -  3.24
- C  =  2.0   -  2.49
- D  =  1.5   -  1.99
- F  =  0     -  1.49

## percent -> letter / This is what Canvas is using
- A  =  90.0  -  100.0
- B  =  80.0  -  89.9
- C  =  70.0  -  79.9
- D  =  60.0  -  69.9
- F  =  0     -  60.0

## SBL percent -> letter / This is what we want displayed (incomplete scale, needs to be fixed)
- A  =  81.25 -  100
- B  =  62.5  -  81
- C  =  50    -  62.25
- D  =  37.5  -  49.75
- F  =  0     -  37.25
